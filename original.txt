Guna is my name. I am a student at PSG College of Technology and am from India. In the IT department, I am in my third year. I enjoy web development and plan to work as a full stack web developer during the holidays. I'm hoping Rajith will respond to my message at some point. I support Virat Kohli and despise Rohit Sharma. I hope India keeps Kohli as captain instead of that dunderhead. DAA and IoT are my current semester's favourite subjects.
