My name is Guna. I am an Indian who studies in PSG College of Technology. I am a 3rd year in the IT department. I love web development and aim to be a full stack web developer over these holidays. I hope Rajith replies to my message one day. I am a Virat Kohli fan and I hate Rohit Sharma. I hope India keeps Kohli as the captain and not that stupid hitman. My favourite subject in my current semester are DAA and IoT.
